This Repo is for sharing some of my previous work

## [eye_damage_test.ipynb](https://github.com/XiangLi368/SkinAndEyeAIModel/blob/main/eye_damage_test.ipynb)
This code is used to load the data, pre-process the image, build the eye damage classification model, and train the model. 

## [Copy_of_Skin_Lesion_RightDS_SamplesizeTesting_SixClasses.ipynb](https://github.com/XiangLi368/SkinAndEyeAIModel/blob/main/Copy_of_Skin_Lesion_RightDS_SamplesizeTesting_SixClasses.ipynb)
This code is used to load the data, pre-process the image, build the skin lesion classification model, and train the model.
